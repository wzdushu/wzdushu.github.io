Argo Workflows implements the entire architecture functionality by abstracting Kubernetes CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions), such as Workflow Template, Workflow, and Cron Workflow. What can Argo workflow do? Define workflows, where each step in the workflow is a container. Model multi-step workflows as a series of tasks, or use directed acyclic graphs (DAGs)</description></item></channel></rss>
